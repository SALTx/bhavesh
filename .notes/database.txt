CURRENT NOTES
(DONE) fix register function
add shift clocking feature (1w+)
signup should be replaced with drop out button
signups should be logged so that the date and time are visible for when the signup was made
event_signup table needs to be modified to show event name as well for better readability and logging purposes
event_signup should have new column active which should be changed to inactive when user cancels their signup
